//Once user is authenticated, they get access to the database (set connection string details)
//But just the boards of sticky notes they signed up for. So they see the list and can access any of their projects
//To join a project, they get invited by the creator/any member ** later consideration
//Meanwhile when they login they can choose to create a new project or can see invitations 
//Access differences between admin/creator of project and other members. Admin can add people can delete the proj??? **lter considerations
